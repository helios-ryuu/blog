## What is On-Premises Infrastructure?

On-premises (often abbreviated as "on-prem") refers to IT infrastructure that is hosted and managed within an organization's own physical location, rather than in a third-party cloud data center.

<Alert type="note">
On-premises doesn't necessarily mean "in the office" — it can include private data centers owned or leased by the organization.
</Alert>

## Why Choose On-Premises?

Organizations opt for on-premises infrastructure for several key reasons:

### 1. Data Sovereignty & Compliance

Many industries have strict regulations about where data can be stored and processed:

- **Healthcare (HIPAA)**: Patient data must meet specific security standards
- **Finance (PCI-DSS)**: Credit card data requires controlled environments
- **Government**: Sensitive data often cannot leave the country

### 2. Performance & Latency

For latency-sensitive applications:

```plaintext
Cloud (typical):     100-200ms round-trip
On-Premises:         1-10ms round-trip
```

### 3. Long-term Cost Control

While cloud offers flexibility, on-premises can be more cost-effective for:

- Predictable, steady workloads
- Large-scale data processing
- High-bandwidth applications

## Core Components

A typical on-premises setup includes:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Servers | Compute resources (physical or virtual) |
| Storage | SAN, NAS, or local disks |
| Networking | Switches, routers, firewalls |
| Power | UPS, generators, PDUs |
| Cooling | HVAC, precision cooling |

## Next Steps

In the next part of this series, we'll dive into **hardware selection and server architecture** for on-premises deployments.

<Alert type="tip">
Before investing in on-premises infrastructure, always perform a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis comparing with cloud alternatives.

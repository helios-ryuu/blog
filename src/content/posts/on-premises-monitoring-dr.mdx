## Infrastructure Monitoring

Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining on-premises infrastructure health and performance.

### Monitoring Stack

A typical monitoring stack for on-premises environments:

```yaml
Metrics Collection:
  - Prometheus: Time-series metrics
  - Telegraf: System and application metrics
  - SNMP: Network device metrics

Visualization:
  - Grafana: Dashboards and alerts
  - Kibana: Log visualization

Log Management:
  - Elasticsearch: Log storage and search
  - Fluentd/Logstash: Log collection
  - Graylog: Centralized logging

Alerting:
  - PagerDuty: On-call management
  - Alertmanager: Alert routing
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are the critical metrics that require 24/7 monitoring.

| Category | Metrics | Alert Threshold |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| CPU | Utilization, Load Average | > 80% sustained |
| Memory | Used, Swap Usage | > 85% used |
| Disk | Space, I/O latency | > 90% full, > 50ms latency |
| Network | Bandwidth, Errors | > 80% utilization |
| Hardware | Temperature, Fan Speed | > 70°C, < 1000 RPM |

## Preventive Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks

```bash
# Check system logs for errors
journalctl -p err --since "1 week ago"

# Verify backup completion
./check_backup_status.sh

# Review security updates
apt list --upgradable
```

### Monthly Tasks

- **Firmware Updates**: Check for BIOS, BMC, and storage firmware updates
- **Cable Management**: Inspect and document cable connections
- **Capacity Review**: Analyze growth trends and plan procurement

### Quarterly Tasks

- **Failover Testing**: Test HA configurations
- **DR Drills**: Practice recovery procedures
- **Hardware Inspection**: Physical inspection of all equipment

## Disaster Recovery

### RPO and RTO

> [!WARNING]
> Define your RPO and RTO before designing your DR strategy.

```plaintext
RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
└── How much data can you afford to lose?
    ├── 0 minutes  → Synchronous replication
    ├── 15 minutes → Continuous replication  
    └── 24 hours   → Daily backups

RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
└── How quickly must systems be restored?
    ├── Minutes → Hot standby
    ├── Hours   → Warm standby
    └── Days    → Cold site with backups
```

### Backup Strategy: 3-2-1 Rule

```plaintext
3 copies of your data
├── Production data
├── Local backup (NAS/SAN)
└── Offsite backup (secondary site or cloud)

2 different storage types
├── Disk-based (fast recovery)
└── Tape or cloud (durability)

1 copy offsite
└── Geographically separated
```

### DR Site Configurations

| Type | Description | Cost | RTO |
|------|-------------|------|-----|
| Hot Site | Fully operational duplicate | $$$$$ | Minutes |
| Warm Site | Hardware ready, data replication | $$$ | Hours |
| Cold Site | Empty facility with power/cooling | $ | Days |

## Runbook Example

For critical recovery scenarios, always have documented runbooks:

```markdown
## Database Server Recovery

### Prerequisites
- Access to backup storage
- Recovery credentials (in vault)
- Network connectivity to DR site

### Steps
1. Assess damage and document
2. Notify stakeholders (use template)
3. Provision replacement hardware or VM
4. Restore from latest backup
5. Apply transaction logs
6. Verify data integrity
7. Update DNS/Load balancer
8. Monitor for 24 hours
9. Post-incident review

### Escalation
- L1: On-call engineer
- L2: Database team lead
- L3: Infrastructure manager
```

## Summary

This concludes our three-part series on on-premises infrastructure:

1. **Part 1**: Introduction and core concepts
2. **Part 2**: Hardware selection and architecture
3. **Part 3**: Monitoring, maintenance, and DR (this post)

> [!TIP]
> Regularly test your disaster recovery procedures. A plan that hasn't been tested is just a theory.

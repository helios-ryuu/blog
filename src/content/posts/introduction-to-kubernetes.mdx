Kubernetes (K8s) has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts you need to get started.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it's now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### Core Concepts

- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
- **Deployment**: Manages the desired state of your pods
- **Service**: Exposes your pods to network traffic
- **Namespace**: Virtual clusters for resource isolation

## Creating Your First Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-first-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
kubectl get pods
```

## Deployments for Production

Pods alone aren't suitable for production. Use Deployments:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.25
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

## Services: Exposing Your Application

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use namespaces** to organize resources
2. **Set resource limits** to prevent runaway containers
3. **Use liveness and readiness probes** for health checks
4. **Store secrets properly** using Kubernetes Secrets
5. **Use Helm** for package management

## Conclusion

Kubernetes provides powerful tools for managing containerized applications at scale. Start with the basics and gradually explore more advanced features like Ingress, ConfigMaps, and StatefulSets.

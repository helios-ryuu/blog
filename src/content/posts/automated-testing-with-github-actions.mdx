# Automated Testing with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides a powerful way to automate your software workflows. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up automated testing pipelines.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines directly in your GitHub repository.

### Key Concepts

- **Workflow**: An automated process defined in YAML
- **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner
- **Step**: An individual task that runs commands or actions
- **Action**: A reusable unit of code

## Creating Your First Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint
```

## Matrix Testing

Test across multiple versions:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18, 20, 22]
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

## Caching Dependencies

Speed up workflows with caching:

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

## Secrets and Environment Variables

Store sensitive data securely:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy
    env:
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
    run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific action versions** (e.g., `@v4` instead of `@latest`)
2. **Cache dependencies** to speed up builds
3. **Run jobs in parallel** when possible
4. **Use branch protection** rules with required checks
5. **Keep workflows DRY** with reusable workflows

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions makes it easy to implement automated testing and CI/CD pipelines. With proper setup, you can catch bugs early and deploy with confidence.
